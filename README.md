## Global Tech Experience Internship - Excel Analysis

**1. Youtube Dataset:âœ…** In this project, I analyzed trending patterns across various video categorieso from Youtube in Excel. 
- I identified numeric columns, excluding certain ones like trending_date, publish_time, and category_id from standard numerical treatment due to their contextual relevance. 
- Additionally, I recognized text columns lacking natural ordering for interpretation beyond their textual representation.
- Further, I determined the number of boolean columns in the dataset. 
- Using functions, I determined the total number of videos, total likes, and average views on trending videos. 
- By sorting and filtering, I found the count of videos published before 2010, the most viewed video outside of Music or Entertainment categories, videos in Gaming and Nonprofits & Activism categories exceeding 10 million views and the average views respectively. 
- Finally, based on the analysis, I concluded that hitting 2 million views in categories like music, gaming, film, and animation isn't particularly exceptional due to the massive fan bases and typical view counts associated with successful content in these genres.
